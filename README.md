# Lung Cancer Detection using VGG16 & EfficientNetB0

## Overview
This is the final project submission for the course CSE424: Pattern Recognition. We focused on building a deep learning pipeline to detect lung cancer using CT scan images. We used the VGG16 and EfficientNetB0 models to predict lung cancer. The dataset that we used can be found here: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/bhmdr45bh2/1. It consists of two key stages:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Prediction Modeling**

The models leverage transfer learning with VGG16 and EfficientNetB0 for classification tasks.
